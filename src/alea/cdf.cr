module Alea
  # The CDF module implements the *Cumulative Distribution Functions* for the supported distributions.
  # The cdf of a real valued random variable X evaluated at x is the probability that X will take a value
  # less or equal to x. It is the inverse of the *Percent Point Function* (PPF), the one used by most of
  # the implementations inside this library to perform sampling.
