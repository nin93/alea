  # where `S32` and `S64` will be targeted as the types of seeds and internal
  # elements of the states.

    # to initialize 64 and 32 state bits, respectively; use `self.init_state` to
    # obtain the generated state. If you want to use them as initializers,
    # remember that they actually return `StaticArray` of unsigned integers.

    # Although @state32 is meant to generate 32-bit unsigned
    # integers, it stores 64-bit unsigned integers internally.
    # 4 is the number of integers stored: this means that this state is
    # loaded with 256 bits.
